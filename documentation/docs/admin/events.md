# Events

Events can be created by `Community Spirit Foundation` staff members or admin users of a team. Public events will be displayed to all viewers of the webapp and private events are used for friendly competition within a single team and will only be displayed to members of that team.

## Create New Public Event

#### Navigating to the events dashboard

Check the `is public` box so that all users can see the event! Ignore `Team id`, this is used for when a team wants to create a private event. Save the form.
